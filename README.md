# All about you!

In this activity students will visualize data about themselves. First, they will a series of questions using a Google Form (e.g. how much time they spend on their screens, sleeping, being physically active, going homework, etc.). Then they will plot these data first using an interactive visualization app, and then writing code in R. The exercises will be scaffolded such that each student can end up with at least one visualization they create regardless of their experience with computers.

Lesson plan:

- 10 minutes - complete survey
- 15 minutes - use interactive app to create a visualization
- 5 minutes - software login
- 25 minutes - writing code to create a visualization
- 5 minutes - printing and wrap up
